	<h1 style="color: teal; text-align: center;">India Shouldn't Play
		Against Pakistan In World Cup 2019": CCI Secretary To BCCI</h1>
	<p>In the wake of the terror attack in Pulwama, where at least 40
		Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed on Thursday,
		Cricket Club of India (CCI) secretary Suresh Bafna on Sunday said that
		India should not play against Pakistan in the upcoming World Cup.
		Suresh Bafna said that since Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has
		not come out openly about the attack in Kashmir, it shows that they
		are at fault somewhere. "We condemn the terror activities carried out
		against our army and CRPF personnel. Though CCI is a sporting
		association but nation comes first even before sports," Bafna told
		ANI. The 2019 World Cup will be held in England and Wales from May 30
		to July 14 and India are scheduled to take on Pakistan on June 16 at
		Old Trafford. "He (Imran Khan) should respond. He is the Prime
		Minister and if he believes that Pakistan has no role to play in the
		attack then why is he not coming out openly. He should come out
		openly. People should know the truth. He is not coming out openly
		which means that there are Stains in their folds," Suresh Bafna added.</p>
